Allows to log out</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>The project is using Firebase as an API server, it allows to log-in and log-out, and also the Dashboard section, which shows the user information and his/her exam results.</li>

</ul><h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>React</li>
</ul><h5>Steps</h5><ul>
<li>"npm start"  <br> <br>Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.   <br> <br>The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.</li>
<li>"npm run eject" <br>  <br>Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!  
 <br> <br>If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  
  <br> <br>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.  
   <br> <br>You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.</li>
   <li>To setup your fitebase server for API, you should register in firebase add database and add the information into src/base.js file </li>
